ofxCocoaWindowNibless

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Inspired from Memo's original ofxCocoaWindow. I didn't want to use Nib files, wanted to be as close to using the GLUT windowing as possible, and needed something that was compatible with OF 007 and GLEW. 


ADDING TO A PROJECT
------------------

1 Add ofxCocoaWindowNibless to addons folder
2 Add CoreVideo.framework
3 Rename any file with Objective-C headers or code will need to be renamed to be Objective-C++ compatible.
<pre>
.cpp to .mm
</pre>
4 Window handle must be passed to testApp if we want to unlink update rate from draw frame rate
<pre>
ofRunApp( new testApp(&cocoaWindow) );
</pre


FUTURE
------

Multi-window with shared GL Context resources. 
Scrollwheel.
Handle OF_FULLSCREEN on launch.
Better handling of window titles.
Drag and Drop.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

ofSetWindowPosition() when called from setup() seems to have no effect. Possibly other window related things in setup() will not work.
